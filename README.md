#### 👋 hey, I’m Alex 

🏫 I am an Electrical & Computer Engineer from Olin College of Engineering. 

🌌 My academic & working experience focus the last couple years has been in Microcode & System Architecture for chip development.

🌱 I have a few interesting projects hosted here, spanning mixed analog & digital VLSI design, scientific computing, and more.
